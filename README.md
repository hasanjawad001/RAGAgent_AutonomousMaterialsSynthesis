# 📄 RAG Pipeline for Hypothesis Refinement in Autonomous Materials Synthesis  

This repository hosts a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** designed for **AI-assisted hypothesis refinement** in autonomous materials synthesis workflows (e.g., Pulsed Laser Deposition – PLD, Remote Epitaxy, BaTiO₃ thin films). The pipeline integrates **state-of-the-art LLMs** with a curated knowledge base of >340 domain-specific literature to guide **experimental design before running autonomous experiments**.  

The system enables researchers to:  
- 📚 Query a domain knowledge base (remote epitaxy, PLD, BaTiO₃, graphene, Raman spectroscopy, etc.).  
- 🧠 Refine experimental hypotheses with **LLM-assisted reasoning + RAG**.  
- ⚙️ Receive suggested parameter ranges and optimization targets for **Bayesian Optimization loops in PLD**.  
- 🔄 Provide experimental results and receive iterative suggestions during **human–AI offline conferences**.

## 🚀 Workflow Overview  

<p align="center">

</p>  

### 📂 Knowledge Base Construction  
- Curated literature (>340) spanning **PLD**, **remote epitaxy**, **graphene**, **BaTiO₃**, **oxide membranes**, **2D material transfer**, **ferroelectricity**, etc.  
- PDFs are parsed, cleaned, chunked, embedded with OpenAI SOTA embedding model, and stored in a **FAISS index** for later query-retrieval procedure.  

### 🧠 AI-Assisted Hypothesis Tuning (Pre-Experiment)  
- Research context + structured prompts are combined with retrieved literature.  
- LLM proposes refined hypotheses, **parameter ranges** (e.g., pressure, substrate temperature, protective layer thickness), and rationale with inline citations.  

### ⚙️ Autonomous PLD Experiments  
- Hypotheses are tested in **batched PLD runs (e.g., 5-10 samples)** using GPBO optimization.  
- Data collection and **Raman spectroscopy analysis** are automated.  

### 🔄 Human–AI Offline Conference  
- During downtime, researchers provide existing data/findings back to the LLM.  
- LLM evaluates progress, suggests surrogate/acquisition function updates, and decides if experiments should continue.

## 🖥️ Usage Instructions  

### 1. Verify API Key  
When you launch the app, you'll be prompted to enter your **OpenAI API key**.  
This is required for generating/using embeddings + GPT responses.  

### 2. Build or Load Knowledge Base  
- **Option A: Build New KB** – Provide a folder of PDFs, select an embedding model  
  (`text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-3-large`), and the system will chunk,  
  embed, and index the documents into FAISS.  
- **Option B: Load Existing KB** – Provide paths to a `.index` file and corresponding `.pkl` metadata.  

### 3. Ask Questions / Hypothesis Tuning  
- Enter your query in the text area (e.g., *“How can PLD parameters be tuned to minimize graphene damage during remote epitaxy?”*).  
- The system retrieves **top-k diverse chunks** (default k=50), augments them with your query, and sends them to the GPT model. The UI allows you to control different configurations e.g., diversity of the retrieved contexts.  
- Output includes: OpenAI's SOTA model response based on the query and the context (e.g., Hypothesis statement, Suggested PLD parameter ranges, Rationale with inline citations, etc.)

### 4. Experimental Feedback Loop  
- During PLD experiment downtime, results are provided back into the system.  
- The LLM suggests **parameter adjustments, surrogate model updates, or experiment stopping criteria**.

### 2. Build a Knowledge Base  
You can create a new knowledge base from domain-specific PDFs.  
- Select an embedding model (`text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-3-large`).  
- Provide the input folder path for your PDFs.  
- Define output locations for the FAISS index and metadata file.

### 3. Load an Existing Knowledge Base  
If you already have a knowledge base built, simply load it by specifying the paths to the `.index` and `.pkl` metadata files.

### 4. Ask Questions with RAG  
Once the knowledge base is ready, you can:  
- Select a GPT model for answering queries.  
- Control **diversity** and **creativity** of responses.  
- Provide a research question to receive a **RAG-informed response**.  
- View references and expand the retrieved context to better understand which sources were used.
